### What is Growth Mindset to me? 

I've read a little about how new neural networks are built in the brain. To take an action or learn something for the first time allows for the glimmer of a new connection and or pathway to begin to form. If it was something you've already done it would simply bolster a pathway you have already established. However when entirely new experiences and information occur they are weak and very temporary, when practiced and reviewed the new pathway begins to solidify, becoming robust and branching off as you continue to advance in this new topic or skill. Beyond the initial learning experience, once a topic or skill is well established, like Mathematics, if it is abandoned entirely it will fade with time, thus spaced repetition is a vital ritual in maintaining your knowledge. Growth Mindset is the belief in this science and applying it to yourself and those around you. One does not need to read about the brain to witness their own and others ability to see progress wherever there is practice. 

- Neurons that fire together wire together. 
- I am water, I can adapt. 
- To my kids “OMG how did you get so good at that?” “I practiced!”
- Think about what I didn’t know the month before.
